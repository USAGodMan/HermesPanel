**HermesPanel** is more than just a port forwarding tool. It's a powerful traffic orchestration platform that gives you complete control over your network flows. Whether you're implementing high availability for your services, conducting A/B tests, or enabling intelligent routing for a multi-region deployment, HermesPanel is built to handle it with ease.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Forwarding for **TCP** and **UDP** traffic, available in both direct and secure tunnel modes.
- **High Availability**:
  - **✅ Health Checks**: Automatically monitor the health of your backend services to get real-time availability status.
  - **✅ Automatic Failover**: Intelligently route traffic away from unhealthy endpoints, ensuring seamless service continuity.
- **Advanced Load Balancing**:
  - **🔀 Multiple Strategies**: Built-in support for **Random**, **Round Robin**, **Weighted Round Robin**, **Least Connections**, and **IP Hash** algorithms.
  - **⚖️ Weighted Targets**: Assign different weights to backend services for fine-grained, proportional traffic distribution.
- **Secure Tunneling**:
  - **🔒 Aether Encryption**: All tunnel traffic is end-to-end encrypted using mutual TLS (Aether) to guarantee data security.
  - **🌍 Global Networking**: Effortlessly build a distributed forwarding network across different regions and cloud providers.
- **Intuitive Web UI**:
  - **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: A comprehensive dashboard to monitor node status (CPU, memory, network), traffic statistics, and performance metrics in real-time.
  - **🕹️ Effortless Management**: A modern web interface to easily manage all users, server nodes, and forwarding rules.
  - **🔗 Diagnostic Tools**: One-click latency and connectivity testing for rules to quickly troubleshoot network issues.
- **Flexible Deployment**:
  - **🐳 One-Click Docker Deploy**: Comes with a complete `docker-compose` setup for launching the entire platform in minutes.
  - **💾 Multi-Database Support**: Compatible with both **SQLite** and **MySQL** to fit needs ranging from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise applications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The recommended way to get started is by using Docker Compose for a one-click deployment.

### Prerequisites

1.  A Linux server with a public IP address (Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 7+ recommended).
2.  A domain name with its A record pointing to your server's public IP.
3.  `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed on your server.
4.  `git` installed on your server.

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HermesPanel.git
    cd HermesPanel
    ```

2.  **Configure your environment**:
    Create a `.env` file from the example template and fill in your domain, database passwords, and security keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```

3.  **Launch the services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    Wait a few minutes for the services to be built and started.

4.  **Access the panel**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `https://your-domain.com` to see the HermesPanel login page.
